![Power BI Dashboard](https://your-image-link-here.com)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes life expectancy data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). Using Power BI, the data has been transformed into interactive visualizations to uncover insights into global health trends, life expectancy rates, and their influencing factors.

## 🗂 Dataset
**Source:** [WHO Life Expectancy Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

**Features:**
- Country
- Year
- Life Expectancy
- Status (Developed/Developing)
- GDP
- Schooling
- BMI
- Alcohol Consumption
- Infant Deaths
- HIV/AIDS Rate

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI:** Data cleaning, transformation, and interactive dashboard creation
- **Excel:** Pre-processing and data exploration
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Advanced calculations and measures

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Health Indicators:**
  - Average life expectancy is 68.75 years.
  - Swaziland, Zimbabwe, and Lesotho have the highest HIV/AIDS rates, with Swaziland reaching 527.1 per 100,000 population.
- **Immunization Rates:**
  - Polio vaccination rate: 81.35%
  - Hepatitis B vaccination rate: 62.89%
  - Diphtheria vaccination rate: 81.46%
